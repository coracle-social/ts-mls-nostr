# ts-mls-nostr
A place to gather thoughts on how to implement NIP-EE using the [ts-mls](https://github.com/LukaJCB/ts-mls) library. 

This library will serve the same purpose as the [nostr-mls](https://github.com/rust-nostr/nostr/tree/master/mls) libraries we wrote that wrap the [OpenMLS](https://github.com/openmls/openmls) library. It's the glue code that implments all the NIP-EE functionality overtop of a complete MLS spec implementation.
